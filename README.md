## How to add screenshots (actual image content)
:information_source: The screenshots visualized by shutterbug are created with the [banner-screenshots application](https://github.com/wmde/banner-screenshots) ). With the `banner-screenshots` application you can generate the metadata summary files `metadata_summary.json` and the images and metadata file `metadata.json` for each campaign.

On your local machine, copy the content (image directory + metadata file) of the `/banner-shots/` directory from the banner-screenhots repository
into the `public/screenshots/` directory of the shutterbug repository.
